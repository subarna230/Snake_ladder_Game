Project Title :

Snake & Ladder with Hurdles (ASCII Console Game in C)

Objective :

The main objective of this project is to develop a console-based Snake & Ladder game in C programming language .

That includes:

Two-player gameplay

Dice rolling functionality

Snakes and ladders mechanics

Hurdles (special traps that send the player back to the start)

ASCII-based board display for interactive gameplay



Description :

This game simulates the classic board game Snake and Ladder but adds an extra challenge in the form of hurdles. Players take turns rolling a dice to move forward:

If a player lands on a ladder, they jump forward to a higher position.

If a player lands on a snake, they slide back to a lower position.

If a player lands on a hurdle, they “die” and are sent back to the start (position 0).

The first player to reach position 100 wins the game.

The game includes an ASCII board where:

[ ] – Empty space

[L] – Ladder

[S] – Snake

[H] – Hurdle

[1] – Player 1

[2] – Player 2

[B] – Both players on same spot

Features:

Two-player support: Allows two players to compete in turns.

Dice roll simulation: Random dice rolling using rand().

Snakes & ladders logic: Realistic positions that advance or decrease player positions.

Hurdle mechanism: Special positions where players return to start.

Interactive ASCII board: Visual display of player positions, snakes, ladders, and hurdles.

Simple, human-readable code: Written for students and beginners to understand game logic.


Uniqueness:

This version of the Snake & Ladder game is unique because:

It includes hurdles, which is not present in traditional versions.

The game uses ASCII representation for a simple yet visually appealing board.

It’s written in plain C without any external libraries, making it easy to understand and modify.

The combination of snakes, ladders, and hurdles adds a strategic element for players.
